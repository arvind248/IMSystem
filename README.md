OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT


INSTITUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is capable of managing all the data related to the institute. It is fully functional software that helps in managing the data related to all tasks of an institute.

This INSTITUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is very beneficial in estimating the real position of the system. It has the following activities:

1. Less paperwork
All the work used to be done on papers but now it can be eliminated & managed on computer that will increase the efficiency of the system. It also helps in searching any data reliably and very fast.

2. Better presentation
All the reports generated in INSTITUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM have the capability of better presentation than manual. We can also modify the presentation according to our requirement.

3. Reduction in consumption of time
The time consumed in duplicating the Reports or list can be reduced much extent by using INSTITUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. A new requirement can also be obtained in very less time.

4. Easy to implement
This system can be implemented in an institute very easily & easy to understand. A user can work on this system by taking a small training very easily.

 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND


In earlier days, the INSTITUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM was working manually, therefore all the processing is to be done by the human beings, therefore the record has to be stored in files, which is very time consuming. Also storing and retrieving records on file is very difficult to maintain, because somehow we lost information in files and if we required it then we get helpless to find them. A big amount is spent in making and maintenance of data and any kind of worms can destroy the files.

Earlier when the number of student is less, it’s not that difficult to maintain the records. But now in institute, the number of student has grown larger and due to this, large quantity of stationary is used. The maintenance and searching the records become very time consuming and tedious.

Now they want to make it computerized to make it cost effective by saving the lots of time, space and by reducing the stationary used.
 
PROBLEM DEFINITION


There are many problems with the current system like:

1)	Time consuming
2)	Wastage of paper
3)	Difficult to search records
4)	Difficult to add/edit records 

Time Consuming

Adding multiple records take a lot of time. Records may be of students and staff member then we have to create a separate register for that. And if we want to search the record, then we have to search all the registers through it. Not only this decreases the reliability of systems but also generates a feeling of uneasiness. It can create a lot of confusion, suppose the handler of the record is not present then all the work could be stopped for that day, which would result in the delay of future work. So we have to waste our time by searching this long procedure, but in this software we don’t have to search it in registers, we can get all the details of the record, just knowing the ID of that record. Next if one record is lost then, making a new record would be a lot of time consuming. 

Wastage of Paper

Many resisters are maintained and multiple records are created which lead to the wastage of paper. First of all the records are created then a registers is maintained for correspondents containing their details e.g. Name, Address, and Phone no etc. 

Difficult to Search Records

It is difficult to extract information from paper records quickly and efficiently, in case of misplace of register, or fail to get it which not only slows the speed to process the records, also increases cost of institute. This costs institute both time and money.

Difficult to add/edit records 

If you want to make changes to a paper-based document, you will need to photocopy the original first - otherwise you will ruin it with edits and comments. This will need to be repeated every time you want to make more amendments and you may end up running out of space if significant alterations are required. Ultimately, editing becomes a messy and time-consuming process that could leave the original document in a sorry state. 
 
 
USER REQUIREMENT


Requirement specification is the starting step for the development activity. During requirement specification, the goal is to produce a document of client’s requirements. This document forms the basis of development and software validation. It provides the technical specifications for the design and development of the software. This document enhances the system’s quality by formalizing communication between the system developer and the user and provides the proper information for accurate documentation. It is at this point that a general statement of software scope is refined into a concrete specification that becomes the foundation for all software engineering activities that follow.


SCOPE

This document is the only that describes the requirements of the system. It is meant for use by the developers and will be the basis for validating the final delivered system. Any changes made to the requirements in the future will have to go through a formal change approval process. The developer is responsible for asking the clarifications, where necessary, and will not make any alteration without the permission of the member.


GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
•	Some of the fields should not contain characters.
•	The name of member contain characters not numeric and special values.
 









 









 
PERT CHART


PERT Chart EXPERT is a Windows-based project management software application that is used to create PERT chart (also known as Network charts, Precedence Diagrams Logic Diagrams). A PERT chart displays the task in a project along with the dependencies between these tasks. Using a PERT chart is a great way to define and display the dependency relationship that exists between tasks. The order in which tasks occur is an important part of project and PERT Chart EXPERT simplifies the process of creating dependencies and displaying dependencies in an easy to follow diagram.

PERT Chart can be used for project planning

As a planning tool, use PERT Chart EXPERT to quickly create project plans by clicking and dragging to create tasks and dependencies between tasks. Plans created in PERT Chart EXPERT can be maintained and managed separately, transferred directly to project.

METHODOLOGY ADOPTED


As the development process specifies the major development & quality assurance activities that need to be performed in the project. The development process forms the core of software process. A production process is a sequence of steps where each step performs a well-defined activity leading towards the satisfaction of the project objectives. The process model specifies the steps to be performed & other in which they need to be performed.



A number of SDLC models have been purposed for developing the system. The models purposed are as follows:

Waterfall Model
Prototyping Model
Iterative Enhancement Model
Spiral Model


The process model, I preferred is Iterative Enhancement (Incremental Model). I preferred this model for the specific reason, as I have understood the design of the overall system and the project is going to be developed in ‘C’. There is a possibility of errors might be occurred and it is going to be difficult to tested in waterfall model as compared to the incremental model. As the advantage of Incremental Model is that it can result in better testing each increment is easier as compared to testing the entire system as in waterfall model.


For example, in the first step of incremental model a simple initial implementation is done for the subset for the overall system. This subset contains some of the aspects of the system. Once it is tested the other subset is designed and integrated with the first one and it is again tested. This process goes on until the system is completed.
 
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE


As we all know the process of developing the system follows a typical set steps. A system project begins with a decision to analyze user requirements. I have used the following steps in developing the project.

Preliminary Investigation

It was quit hard decision to take this project into my account, because I had to collect so many data to complete this project, with this, I can complete it. I have made a plan after listening to the user that how I would take on this project to complete it.

1.	 Feasibility Study

As the system was earlier a manual system and user wants to make it computerized, a feasibility study is undertaken to determine how to develop the existing system into a computerized system.

A.	Technical Feasibility

As this project is going to be developed in ‘C’ there is possibility that errors can occur, because it is in inbuilt function. But as much I could I took this very seriously and made this project error free but in case, some unusual things happens, then it would necessary to restart this software to get maximum output and without corrupting records. After developing this project, it will be able to produce outputs with a certain speed.

		
B.	Economical Feasibility

Economic feasibility is the most important study that determines the cost and benefits of the proposed system and compares with the budget. The cost of the new system does not outweigh the budget.  The cost of the project includes the cost of hardware, software, development and implementation. The new system also provides benefits that are expected from the proposed system and compare these with the costs expected to spend on development of the system. Benefits are found to be more than costs, thus it is decided to develop new system. The new system provides both tangible (e.g. improved organizational planning, improved assets utilization, etc) in a formal way. Thus the new system is economical feasible.


C.	Operational Feasibility

It is found that the new system is both economic and technical feasible, the next step is to determine whether it is operationally feasible or not. During operational feasibility study, it is found that the system will operate in the way that user wants. There is enough human resources and there are qualified and experienced manpower available for development and implementation of the system. The new system is acceptable to the people and management. Thus the new system is also operational feasible. User involvement is more determining the operational feasibility.
 
2.  System analysis

This system analysis I go through my all the data I have collected and consulted with my project guide how I am going to carry out my project. In doing this he helped me a lot, he suggested to me how I should made this project, and how important that it should be modularized. Now after analysis I have proper understanding of what is to be done.
3.	 System design
As expected this was the toughest phase to design a system. It requires a lot of creativeness. I took it as a challenge and started working on it. The first thing I did is I designed all the forms that are required to display the output in what format and also how the input is to be taken. Then I showed all the input and output forms to my project guide and take his thought about the forms, he suggested little changes that I did, after forms designing I decided, how I am going to store and retrieve all the data.
4.	Development of software
Now as the system designed, I started developing it into the code. I started with the form design that is required, then how to take an input from the user, and after that how to store and retrieve it from the file to meet all the requirements. As in my software there is lot of models I took on one model at a time.
5.	System testing and integration
This is very important phase. Integration as name suggests involves bringing all the modules together into a testing environment, then checking for errors, bugs, and interpretability. After the integration of the system, testing is performed. The objective behind the testing is to find errors. During, testing, the program to be tested is executed with a set of test cases, and the output of the program is evaluated to determine if the program is performing as expected. Due to this approach, dynamic testing can only show the presence of errors in the program. Effective testing will contribute to the delivery of high quality software products, more satisfied users, lower maintenance costs, and more accurate and reliable results.
6.	Maintenance
This is the final stage of project development where the software is put into production and runs actual business. In this the software is delivered to the customer’s site, installed and is operational. Therefore, release of software inaugurates the operation and maintenance phase of SDLC. It includes the usage, evaluation, and modification if necessary of the phase to keep the system in operation. It is to build an ongoing system. The user has to make a back up of files in that folder which software has been placed.

DATA DICTIONARY


In above data flow diagram, we give names to data flows. Processes and data stores . Although the names are descriptive of the data, they do not give details. So following the DFD, our interests is to build some structured place to keep details of the contents of data flows, processes and data stores. A data dictionary is a structured repository of data about data sometimes called as metadata. The associated data dictionary states precisely the structure of each data flow in DFD.

TESTING

Once source coding is completed, the testing of the system is done. The software must be tested to check and remove as many errors as possible. After testing, the software is delivered to the customer. There are four different levels of testing used in the testing process.

1)	Unit Testing

At this level, different modules are tested against the specifications produced during the design for the module. It is done by the programmer of the module. Unit testing is done at the time coding. 

2)	Integration Testing

At this stage, many unit tested modules are integrated together into subsystems, which are then tested and it is checked that modules are integrated properly or not, that is, interfaces between the modules are working properly or not. It is also done by the programmer.

3)	System Testing

Here the entire software is tested. It is seen that the software meets its requirements properly or produce some errors. The system is checked against each of the requirements from the system.

4)	Acceptance Testing

At this level, the system is tested by inputting some realistic data and seeing the outputs. This is the last stage of testing. After this stage, the system is implemented at the user site.
Above are the levels of testing. Beyond the levels, there are two types of testing. 

a)	Black-Box Testing

In Black-Box testing, it is checked that input is properly accepted and output is correctly produced, and that the integrity of all the information is maintained. Black-box tests are used to demonstrate that software functions are operational.

b)	White-Box Testing
White-Box testing, sometimes called glass-box testing , is a test case design method that uses the control structure of the procedural design to derive test cases. It guarantees that all independent paths within a module have been exercised at least once. It exercise all logical decisions. 

After testing, the implementation of the system is done. Implementation includes all those activities that take place to convert an old system to a new computerized system. The new system may be totally new replacing an existing system or it may be a modification to an existing system.
 

LIMITATIONS OF THE PROJECT

Since, every system has some limitations so our proposed system is also not untouchable in this regard. Although it includes every kind of features, but it can’t be used in a huge organization where number of networks are very large, because the database used in this system is an average one. Also it doesn’t have different kind of access feature for different users.

 Though it was planned for this system to be absolutely perfect but everything as such has some limitations, so does the System. Following may be the drawback in this system.

•	Though this system is developed as a multi user system but it is not a real time system.
•	The interaction with the database, every time they are loaded thus the system tends to be a   bit slow.
•	In the system there is no validation such as it accept the alphabet abc ….. ABC or numerical 123…..
•	In the system the user give the date and time input as per their choice, there is no any specific date & time picker.
